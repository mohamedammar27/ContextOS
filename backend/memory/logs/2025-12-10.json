The session will be divided into two major phases:\n\nAgenda:\n\nPhase 1: Understanding the Use Case & Why UiPath Agent\n• Defining Problem Statement: What business challenge we are addressing and what outcome we aim to achieve.\n• Why UiPath Agent?: Explanation of why this scenario is a strong fit for an agentic automation approach instead of a traditional RPA workflow.\n• Complexity Breakdown\n• Document/process complexity\n• Decision-making needs\n• Why an agent-driven, iterative approach is more suitable\n• Expected behaviour and constraints\nThis phase sets the context for when and why organisations should prefer UiPath Agents.\n\nPhase 2: Hands-On Build – End-to-End Agentic Automation\nParticipants will follow along as we construct the full solution:\n\nBuilding the Base RPA Workflow\n\n• Creating the underlying sequence/process\n• Implementing reusable components\n• Preparing the workflow for agent integration\n\nCreating the UiPath Agent\n\n• Defining the agent\n• Connecting the workflow to the agent\n• Configuring prompts, capabilities, and agentic logic\n• Testing the agent behaviour\n\nBuilding the UiPath App\n\n• Designing an app interface for users to interact with the agent\n• Linking the app to the agent for real-time responses\n• Passing inputs/outputs and handling human-agent communication\n\nOrchestrating the Entire Flow\n\n• Using UiPath Orchestrator to bind workflows, apps, and the UiPath Agent\n• Setting up triggers and execution flows\n• Demonstration of the full agentic workflow in action\n• Monitoring and managing the automation\n\nQ&A + Open discussion, clarifications.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nGet ready with your laptop\n\nUiPath Automation Cloud account\n\nSign in to cloud.uipath.com\n\nEnable preview features in your organisation settings\n\nGood to Have (not mandatory)\n\nUnderstanding of Agent fundamentals\n\nSee you super soon\n\n\n\nSee you there!\nRSVP\n\n\n\t\nDate & time\n\nTue, Dec 16, 4:00 PM (GMT+5:30)\n\nAdd to Google · Outlook · iCal · Yahoo\n\n Stay updated on the latest news and resources by subscribing to the Community Newsletter.\n\n Read the Welcome guide to find out how to make the most of your UiPath Community experience.\n\n\n\nClick here for the UiPath Community Code of Coduct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsubscribe\nReply\nForward\nYou can't react with an emoji to a group"
